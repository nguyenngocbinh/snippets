### Explanation of Deployment-Related Directories:
- **/src/deploy**: Contains the code and scripts needed to deploy your model. This could include API creation (e.g., Flask or FastAPI), Docker configurations for containerization, and other necessary scripts.
  - **/api**: Code to expose your model as a service, allowing for inference via REST APIs or other interfaces.
  - **/docker**: Dockerfiles and related configurations to containerize your application for consistent deployment across environments.
  - **/scripts**: Shell scripts, CI/CD pipeline scripts, and other tools to automate the deployment process.
  
- **/deploy**: Contains infrastructure-related files for deploying your model in various environments, such as Kubernetes configurations, Terraform scripts for infrastructure as code, and AWS-specific deployment configurations.
  - **/kubernetes**: Kubernetes configuration files, like deployment and service YAMLs, for deploying the model in a Kubernetes cluster.
  - **/terraform**: Terraform scripts to provision infrastructure in a cloud environment.
  - **/aws**: AWS-specific files like CloudFormation templates, Lambda functions, or other AWS services configuration files.
