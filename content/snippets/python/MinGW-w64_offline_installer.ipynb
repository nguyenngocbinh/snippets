    "# MinGW-w64 offline installer\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Install MSYS2**\n",
    "   - Download the installer for MSYS2 from its [official website](https://www.msys2.org/).\n",
    "   - Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to install MSYS2 (usually in `C:/msys64`).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 **Download Individual Packages**\n",
    "If you're preparing an offline repository:\n",
    "1. On a system with internet access, use the `pacman` command to generate download links for all required packages:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   pacman -Sp --needed base base-devel mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain > package_list.txt\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - This creates a file `package_list.txt` with URLs for all the required packages.\n",
    "2. Download all the packages from the generated list and copy them to your `offline_packages` folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 **Copy Offline Packages**\n",
    "   - Insert the flash drive containing the `offline_packages` folder.\n",
    "   - Copy the folder to a path accessible by MSYS2. For example:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     C:/msys64/home/BinhNN2/offline_packages\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - Ensure the path structure is correct and matches the instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Navigate to the Offline Packages Directory**\n",
    "   Open your MSYS2 terminal and navigate to the directory where the `offline_packages` folder is located:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   cd /home/BinhNN2/offline_packages\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Recreate the Database Archive**\n",
    "   Use the `repo-add` command to generate a valid `offline.db`:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   repo-add offline.db.tar.gz *.pkg.tar.*\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - **Explanation**:\n",
    "     - `repo-add`: This command generates or updates a repository database file.\n",
    "     - `offline.db.tar.gz`: This ensures the correct extension is used for the database archive.\n",
    "     - `*.pkg.tar.*`: Matches all package files in the directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "   After running this command, you should see output indicating that the database file has been created and updated.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Edit pacman.conf**\n",
    "   - Open the MSYS2 configuration file for pacman using a text editor:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     C:/msys64/etc/pacman.conf\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - Locate and **comment out** the following repositories by adding a `#` at the beginning of their lines:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     # [mingw32]\n",
    "     # Include = /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist.mingw32\n",
    "\n",
    "     # [mingw64]\n",
    "     # Include = /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist.mingw64\n",
    "\n",
    "     # [msys]\n",
    "     # Include = /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist.msys\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - Add a new repository definition for the offline packages at the bottom:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     [offline]\n",
    "     SigLevel = Optional\n",
    "     Server = file:///home/BinhNN2/offline_packages\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - Save and close the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Synchronize Pacman Database**\n",
    "   - Open an MSYS2 terminal (`msys2.exe`) and run:\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     pacman -Syu\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - This synchronizes the package manager with your offline repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. **Install Required Packages**\n",
    "   - Install the required development tools and toolchain packages:\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     pacman -S --needed base base-devel mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - Ensure the installation completes successfully.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. **Validation**\n",
    "   - Test the installation by running a simple command, such as checking the GCC version:\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     gcc --version\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - If the version is displayed, the setup is complete.\n"
