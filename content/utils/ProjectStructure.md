# Project Structure Best Practices

## Overview

This document outlines the best practices for organizing project files and folders, including general principles and the specific structure used in this snippets repository.

## 📁 Snippets Repository Structure

The current repository uses the following organized structure:

```
📁 snippets/
├── 📁 docs/                          # Documentation and configuration
│   ├── _quarto.yml                   # Main Quarto configuration
│   ├── index.qmd                     # Homepage content
│   ├── theme.scss & theme-dark.scss  # Website styling
│   ├── include-files.lua             # Quarto filter
│   └── 📁 assets/

├── LICENSE
├── README.md
└── .gitignore
```

## 🎯 Key Principles

### 1. **Separation of Concerns**
- **`docs/`**: Configuration, themes, and documentation-specific files
- **`content/`**: All user-facing content organized by topic
- **`_site/`**: Generated output (excluded from version control)

### 2. **Logical Content Organization**
- **`tutorials/`**: Step-by-step learning materials by technology
- **`snippets/`**: Quick reference code samples by programming language
- **`comparisons/`**: Side-by-side technology analysis
- **`machine-learning/`**: Specialized ML content
- **`utils/`**: Utilities and best practices documentation

## 📋 General Data Science Project Structure

For reference, here's a comprehensive structure for data science projects:

```
/Project_Name

├── /data
│   ├── /raw                 # Raw data, untouched, as received
│   ├── /processed           # Processed data, cleaned and transformed
│   └── /external            # External data sources, if applicable
│
├── /notebooks               # Jupyter or other notebook files

│       └── /scripts         # Deployment scripts (e.g., bash, CI/CD)
│
├── /models                  # Saved models (e.g., pickled or HDF5 files)
│
├── /results                 # Outputs from models (e.g., predictions, metrics)

│
├── /logs                    # Logs for training, experiments, etc.
│
├── /tests                   # Unit and integration tests for the codebase
│
├── /config                  # Configuration files (e.g., for hyperparameters, environment settings)
│
├── /docs                    # Documentation for the project
│   ├── /references          # Research papers, articles, and references

│
└── /deploy                  # Deployment infrastructure files
    ├── /kubernetes          # Kubernetes configuration files
    ├── /terraform           # Terraform scripts for infrastructure as code
    └── /aws                 # AWS-specific deployment configurations (e.g., CloudFormation)
```

### Explanation of Deployment-Related Directories:
- **/src/deploy**: Contains the code and scripts needed to deploy your model. This could include API creation (e.g., Flask or FastAPI), Docker configurations for containerization, and other necessary scripts.
  - **/api**: Code to expose your model as a service, allowing for inference via REST APIs or other interfaces.
  - **/docker**: Dockerfiles and related configurations to containerize your application for consistent deployment across environments.
  - **/scripts**: Shell scripts, CI/CD pipeline scripts, and other tools to automate the deployment process.
  
- **/deploy**: Contains infrastructure-related files for deploying your model in various environments, such as Kubernetes configurations, Terraform scripts for infrastructure as code, and AWS-specific deployment configurations.
  - **/kubernetes**: Kubernetes configuration files, like deployment and service YAMLs, for deploying the model in a Kubernetes cluster.
  - **/terraform**: Terraform scripts to provision infrastructure in a cloud environment.
  - **/aws**: AWS-specific files like CloudFormation templates, Lambda functions, or other AWS services configuration files.
